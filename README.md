# Recognising Sanskrit Text from PDF
This project is a sub-task for research conducted at IIT Bombay, here we aim to extract or detect regional languages from a given document that can be further used for bigger purposes.

## Project:
The project was solely built using Image Processing techniques i.e. the OpenCV library of Python, the computer vision methods were to used to draw bounding boxes on Sanskrit text only even though the document consisted of both English and a regional language (Sanskrit here). 

## Result:
The result is a set of coordinates of bounding boxes enclosing the Sanskrit text
